Factors:  risk & volatility

* Risk 0.8% - 2.0%
* ongoing position sizing
   * peel off contracts/shares as exposure increases
* Near Stops
   * small R -> high shares -> huge capital requirement
   * keep stop, position size in terms of volatility
   * position size = min(position_risk/$risk, position_risk/atr)
* Market's Money
   * equity earned from the market
   * risk higher percentage of market money than for starting equity
   i.e., risk 1% of starting equity % 5% of market money
   * annually or quarterly - market money -> my money
